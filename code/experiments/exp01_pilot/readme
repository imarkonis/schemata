Pilot experiment for classification of terrestrial drainage basins and river networks

Workflow:

1. Set region coordinates and drainage basin size in pilot.R

2. Import/download geodata (exp01_01 files).

3. Merge geodata

4. Estimate basin features from their geometric properties

5. Classify basins by the features (Self-Organizing Maps)

6. Post process and plot the classification results.
